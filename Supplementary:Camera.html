    <h1>CSCI 420 Programming Assignment 2: Camera Movement</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
		If you don't properly keep track of your coordinate system as you move from one position 
		to the next along your spline, then your up vector may end up pointing in a random direction 
		each time, causing your camera to rotate very unpredictably.  Below is a summary of a method 
		by Ken Sloan which you might use to move your up vector in a manner which doesn't nauseate the 
		viewer!
		</p><P>
		</p>
	<h2>Coordinate Transitions</h2>
		<p>
		Sloan's method decides each coordinate system using a function of the previous one, to 
		ensure continuity.  There are three vectors that we care about for each position P along 
		the length of the spline--these are the tangent, the normal, and the binormal (often called
		T, N, and B, or collectively the Frenet Frame).  
		The tangent is already known at each position--it can be acquired from the derivative of your 
		spline function.  The vectors which must be decided by this method are N and B.
 		</p>
		<p>
		First, you'll need to generate your starting set of axes at point P0, given T0.  The easiest 
		way to do this (perhaps not the best) is as follows:  Pick an arbitrary vector V.  
		Make N0 = unit(T0 x V) 
		and B0 = unit(T0 x N0), where unit(u) is the normalization of vector u, or u/|u|.  You now have a 
		starting set of coordinates.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now you simply need a function to calculate a set of coordinate vectors given the previous set.  
		Given a previous set at P0 and the desired new set at P1, a good way to do this is to let 
		N1 = unit(B0 x T1) and B1 = unit(T1 x N1).
		</p>
		
	<h2>Application</h2>
		<p>
		The coordinates as determined above are useful in two areas of the lab--the first is orienting 
		the camera as it moves along the roller coaster.  The second is deciding the orientation of 
		features of the track itself (rails, cross-sections, etc) when you draw them to the screen.  
		Both of these may be accomplished as a function of P, T, N, and B at any given point.
